- **üé® Modern UI Design**: Professional glassmorphism interface with integrated header and logo-only branding
- **üìß Gmail Integration**: Full two-factor authentication support with custom SMTP implementation
- **üîÑ Real-time Monitoring**: Live WebSocket updates every 60 seconds for EG4 data
- **üìä Complete SRP Integration**: All 4 chart types (Net Energy, Generation, Usage, Demand) with CSV export
- **üö® Smart Alert System**: Timezone-aware alerts with anti-spam protection
- **üîß Web-based Configuration**: Complete credential and settings management through web interface
- **üì± Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes with touch-friendly controls
- **üõ†Ô∏è Production Ready**: Systemd service support for automatic startup

## Architecture Overview

This is a **monolithic Flask application** with real-time web scraping and WebSocket communication running on **port 5002**.

### Core Components
- **`app.py` (1,800+ lines)**: Main Flask server containing all business logic
  - EG4/SRP/Enphase data extraction using Playwright browser automation
  - Socket.IO WebSocket handlers for real-time dashboard updates
  - Background monitoring threads with intelligent retry logic
  - Gmail SMTP alert system with timezone-aware scheduling
  - RESTful API endpoints for configuration and data management
  - SQLite database for data persistence and historical tracking

- **`templates/index.html` (2,100+ lines)**: Single-page progressive web application
  - Real-time updates via Socket.IO client with auto-reconnection
  - Chart.js visualizations for multi-dimensional energy data
  - Integrated header with professional logo and navigation design
  - Complete configuration interface with credential management
  - Mobile-optimized responsive design with glassmorphism styling
  - System log viewer with filtering and download capabilities

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright handles authentication and data scraping for all 3 systems
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO broadcasts live updates to connected web clients
- **Background Processing**: Threaded monitoring (EG4: 60s, SRP: daily, Enphase: 60s)
- **Configuration Persistence**: JSON config in `./config/config.json` with web management
- **Session Management**: Persistent browser sessions (~1 hour) to minimize login overhead
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database for metrics storage and retrieval

## Essential Commands

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# Set up directories
mkdir -p logs config downloads

# Configure credentials through web interface
python app.py
# Navigate to http://localhost:5002 ‚Üí Configuration tab

# Install as systemd service (see systemd section below)
sudo cp eg4-srp-monitor.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable eg4-srp-monitor
sudo systemctl start eg4-srp-monitor
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development server
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py

# View application logs
tail -f logs/eg4_srp_monitor.log

# Access web interface
open http://localhost:5002

# Monitor service status

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Single-file architecture**: All Python logic in `app.py` for simplicity
- **Template-based UI**: All frontend code in `templates/index.html`
- **Modular functions**: Clear separation of concerns within the monolithic structure
- **Comprehensive logging**: 5-level logging system with web interface access

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Background Threads**: Collect data from EG4, SRP, and Enphase systems
2. **Data Validation**: Verify connection status and data integrity
3. **Database Storage**: Persist metrics to SQLite for historical analysis
4. **WebSocket Broadcasting**: Push real-time updates to connected web clients
5. **Alert Processing**: Evaluate thresholds and send notifications as needed

### Adding New Features
1. **Backend**: Add new functions to `app.py` following existing patterns
2. **Frontend**: Update `templates/index.html` with new UI elements
3. **Real-time Updates**: Use `socketio.emit()` to broadcast changes
4. **Configuration**: Add new settings to the web configuration interface
5. **Testing**: Use the built-in test functions and log monitoring

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Retry Logic**: 3 login attempts with exponential backoff
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic re-authentication on session expiry
- **Connection Validation**: Prevent false alerts when systems are offline
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue monitoring other systems if one fails

## Deployment Architecture

### Systemd Service Integration
The application runs as a systemd service for automatic startup and management:

```bash
# Service management commands
sudo systemctl start eg4-srp-monitor    # Start service
sudo systemctl stop eg4-srp-monitor     # Stop service  
sudo systemctl restart eg4-srp-monitor  # Restart service
sudo systemctl status eg4-srp-monitor   # Check status
sudo journalctl -u eg4-srp-monitor -f   # View service logs
```

### Network Configuration
- **Port**: 5002 (configurable in app.py)
- **Protocol**: HTTP with WebSocket upgrades
- **Access**: Typically localhost/LAN only for security
- **Firewall**: Configure as needed for remote access

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: ~100MB typical usage
- **CPU**: <1% typical load, spikes during data collection
- **Disk**: Minimal (logs rotate, CSV files are cleaned periodically)
- **Network**: Outbound HTTPS for data collection and Gmail SMTP

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- All credentials stored in local files with restricted permissions (600)
- Gmail App Passwords required (not regular passwords)
- Web interface uses HTTPS recommended for remote access
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

### Network Security
- Application binds to localhost by default
- No authentication required (intended for trusted networks)
- Consider reverse proxy with authentication for internet exposure
- Regular security updates for dependencies
